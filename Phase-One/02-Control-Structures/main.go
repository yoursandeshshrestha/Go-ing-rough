	// Defer statement
	// In Go, the defer keyword is used to delay the execution of a function or statement until the surrounding function returns.

// Additional Notes:
// If-else: Go doesn't require parentheses around conditions, but curly braces {} are mandatory.
// For Loop: Go uses a single loop construct (for), which can be used like while and do-while from other languages.
// Switch: Goâ€™s switch is more powerful, supporting multiple cases on one line and not requiring explicit break statements.
// while loop: Go doesn't have a while loop. You can use a for loop to achieve the same effect.
// Defer: Executes the deferred function after the surrounding function completes.
